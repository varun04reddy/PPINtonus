PPINtonus is a network for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease utilizing deep-learning
tonal analysis, a cost-effective and coherent alternative to neurological examinations for
diagnosing Parkinson's Disease. Partnering with the Parkinson's Voice Project (PVP), gaining
extensive research and years of data regarding the disease, PPINtonus utilizes a semi-supervised
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to generate viable data points synthetically.
Training the model based on the given synthetically generated data points, a multi-layered deep
neural network will learn and predict Parkinson's disease with increased precision and accuracy.
Integrating PRAAT phonetics software to derive biomedical voice measurement values of
patients performing a vocal test, PPINtonus will accurately assess a given patient for Parkinson's
Disease. A confusion matrix was produced to visualize the false negative values produced by the
neural model to evaluate the accuracy. With a false negative value of 3 (FN=3) out of 10,367
data points, the model has proven to assess Parkinson's with a low false-negative rate.
Additionally, the model achieved 93.9% accuracy, 1.0 recall rate, and 92.7% precision, deeming
the model both accurate and precise. Training upon an epoch value of 1000 ensures the model's
efficiency while reducing the possibility of overfitting the model and minimizing loss.
PPINtonus has been demonstrated to be a viable prerequisite for early identification and
classification of Parkinson's through tensor vector analysis. The non-intrusive and efficient
method can help treat millions of Parkinson's patients through early diagnosis to preserve
patients' quality of life.
